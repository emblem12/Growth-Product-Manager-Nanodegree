 # Project 1: Growth and Acquisition Strategy-Crafting a Growth Loop
 
 > In this project,I assumed the role of the Growth Product Manager at Craft Snacks, a hypothetical e-commerce company offering monthly 
   subscriptions of artisan snack boxes. I created a presentation deck to propose a user acquisition and growth plan based on the business 
   context that was provided. The presentation deck consisted of four main sections: Inspecting the landscape, Mapping the Path to Growth, Validating the Path to Growth,
   and Developing a Growth Vision. I demonstrated the skills to assess the current state of the business as is, and then created the path to 
   the future to-be state by building my own growth loop, setting up a test that validates the loop, and proposing an expansion to the loop.
   
   
   
# Project 2: Activation and Retention Strategy - Let It Grow.

> In this project, I served as the Growth Product Manager for productboard and Slack to optimize the sign-up flow to ensure maximum conversions, 
  determine the activation funnel, create a retention curve, and perform a churn analysis. Then, I suggested experiments to improve overall activation and retention.
  
  
  
# Project 3: Monetization Strategy - Priceless Penny

> In this project, I built a monetization model for a post-revenue B2B SaaS business, and then came up with hypotheses about potential changes 
to the monetization strategy including changing pricing metrics and plans.
